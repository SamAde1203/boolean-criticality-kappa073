  "description": "Complete code, data, and supplementary materials for the manuscript 'Phase Transitions in Biological Organisation: The κ=0.73 Threshold'. Includes: (1) Analytical derivation of β=0.36 from degree distribution moments; (2) Python scripts for Boolean network simulation (N=10,000 networks); (3) R scripts for all manuscript figures and statistical analyses; (4) Empirical network dataset (n=48 biological Boolean networks); (5) Supplementary Notes S1-S3 and Tables S1-S2. Key finding: κ_c=0.73±0.02 as universal critical threshold for effective connectivity in biological networks, derived from first principles as β×K_c^hom where β=⟨k⟩²/⟨k²⟩≈0.36 for power-law networks with γ=2.3.",
