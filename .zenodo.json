  "description": "Complete code, data, and supplementary materials for the manuscript 'Phase Transitions in Biological Organisation: The kappa=0.73 Threshold'. Includes: (1) Analytical derivation of beta=0.36 from degree distribution moments; (2) Python scripts for Boolean network simulation; (3) R scripts for all manuscript figures; (4) Empirical network dataset (48 biological Boolean networks); (5) Supplementary Notes and Tables. Key finding: kappa_c=0.73 as universal critical threshold for effective connectivity in biological networks.",
